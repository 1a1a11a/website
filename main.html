      <p> I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Division in School of Applied Science and Engineering at
        Harvard University. I received my Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University in 2024. </p>
      <p>I am broadly interested in <b>storage systems</b>, <b>data management</b> and <b>machine learning
          systems</b> with particular interests on <b>system measurement, workload analysis, and sustainable system
          design</b>.
        I like performing measurement and analysis to get deep understanding of existing systems.
      </p>
      <!-- On the data management and storage system side, I have worked on various cache systems (block, key-value, CDN) and large-scale distributed storage systems to improve the efficiency, performance and reliability. -->
      <!-- On the machine learning system side, I am interested in applying lightweight machine learning to improve the efficiency of storage systems (ML for system), and building efficient deep learning systems (system for ML).  -->

      <!-- My faviourite article is John's <i><a target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3213770"> Always measure one-level deeper</a></i>. -->
      <!-- Many of my works draw inspirations from observations and measurements in production systems. -->

      <p> My works have received best-paper awards at NSDI'24, NSDI'21, SOSP'21, and SYSTOR'16 and have been deployed in
        production at Google, VMware, Twitter, Redpanda, Momento with many open-source libraries contributed by the
        community.
