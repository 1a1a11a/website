Interests 
Up till now, my academic life can be divided into two parts. 
The first one is related to chemistry, material and environmental science. And the second part is in computer science and engineering. Due to my strong interest in computer science and desire for solving problems in everyday life, currently my main focus is on computer science. 

My interests in this area mainly focus on developing new materials for
solving energy and environment problem. Here are some my past projects.

Life 
I have several hobbies in the life except talking :(. 
Programming is the first one. 
Photography is the second one. I like good photos, however I do not have sufficient talent in art and my photos are always not good. 
Traveling, traveling enables me to see the bigger world and think about my life and the world. Of course, the other reason for traveling is to see beautiful scenes and taking <strong> PHOTOS</strong>. 
Badminton. Maybe this is the only sport I am good at? But indeed, I do like playing badminton and I am kindly of good at it. 
Eating and cooking. Eating food is one of the most important things in everyday life, no one can escape it, so why not enjoy it? Therefore, having lunch and dinner is one of my most enjoyable time during a day. Maybe inherit from my chemical experience, besides eating food, I am also very interested in preparing food. I like to try new recipe and improve it step by step. 
Playing cards. When getting together with friends, one of our favorite activities is playing cards, military chess and other kinds of desktop game.
